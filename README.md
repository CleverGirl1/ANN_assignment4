Submission for Assignment 4 For ANN


Breast Cancer Data Analysis and Streamlit App
This project performs an analysis of the Breast Cancer dataset using machine learning, and builds an interactive web app using Streamlit.

Steps Involved
Step 1: Project Setup
Create a Project Directory: Set up a directory for your project and initialize a Git repository.
Set Up a Virtual Environment: Create and activate a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.
Step 2: Dataset Acquisition and Preparation
Download the Dataset: Download the Breast Cancer dataset from a reliable source (e.g., UCI Repository or sklearn.datasets).
Data Preparation: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and splitting it into features (X) and target (y).
Step 3: Feature Selection
Feature Selection: Use SelectKBest from sklearn.feature_selection to select the most important features.
Step 4: Grid Search CV for Model Tuning
Grid Search: Use GridSearchCV to tune the hyperparameters of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model (MLPClassifier).
Step 5: Implementing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model
ANN Model: Create, train, and evaluate an ANN model using MLPClassifier to classify the dataset.
Step 6: Building a Streamlit App Locally
Streamlit Setup: Install Streamlit and create an app that allows users to interact with the data and model predictions.
Develop the App: Integrate user input for model predictions and display results interactively.
Step 7: Deployment and Version Control
GitHub Repository: Set up a GitHub repository, commit code, and push changes regularly.
Submission: Submit the Python scripts, Streamlit app code, and this README.md file to GitHub.
Additional Tips
Documentation: Ensure that the code is well-documented with comments to explain each step.
Exploration: Experiment with different feature selection techniques, ANN architectures, and hyperparameter tuning.
